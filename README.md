# QHacks-2019
This project was begun by three members at QHacks 2019, a 36-hour hackathon held at Queen's University.

This project takes a class syllabus in PDF form and converts it into an ICAL file which can be opened on Outlook or Google Calendars.
Each calendar event includes the name of the event (QUIZ, TEST), the date (MM/DD/YYYY), and the specific line from the file.

The project is successful in some sense, in that the code successfully converts text to ICAL.
However, we faced difficulty reading the text from tables in the PDF and were unable to resolve this before the end of the hackathon.

Work to be continued
